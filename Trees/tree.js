 * An Internal node is a node with atleast one or more children.
 * A node which has no children is called an External node.
 *
 * A node can have ancestors and descendants. Ancestors of a node(except the root node)
 * are parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and so on.

 * The descendants of a node are children(child), grandchildren(grandchild),
 * great-grandchildren(great-grandchild), and so on.
 *
 * Depth of a node consists of the number of ancestors.
