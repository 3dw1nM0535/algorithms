# Data Structures and Algorithms

This guide focuses on various algorithms in Computer Science.

Code samples and examples are commented out for illustrations on various code block scope to help even the non-cs to understand what is going on under the hood.

Various algorithms are defined within function block scope and ported to work anywhere with test data.

Every function has a test example data to test its expectation and efficiency.

You can clone this repo or fork, whichever is best for you because you gonna like this tutorials i bet! 

## Let's code now!
