# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms

This guide focuses on various data structures and algorithms in Computer Science.

Code samples and examples are commented out for illustrations on various code block scope to help even the non-cs to understand what is going on in the code.

Various algorithms are defined within function block scope and ported to work anywhere with test data.

Every function has a test example data to test its expectation and efficiency.

Also the Big O running time complexity is illustrated on some sorting and searching algorithm.

### Some of the CS concepts discussed.
