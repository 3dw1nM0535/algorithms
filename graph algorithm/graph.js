              /* Graph algorithms.
              ===================
/**
 * Graph algorithm consist of vertices and edges.
 * Vertex is a point in a graph and edges is a path connecting the vertex
 * edges are defined as a pair(v1, v2) which are two vertices in a graph
 * Vertex can have a weight known as cost
 * Graph whose pair is ordered is known as directed or digraph graph
 * An example is a flowchart which shows computations
 * of a computer program
 * A graph which is not ordered is known as an unordered graph or just a graph
 * A path is a sequence of vertices in a graph such that all vertices in the path
 * are connected by edges. Length of a path is the number of edges from the first vertex
 * in the path to the last vertex. A path can also consist of a vertex to itself, which is
 * called a loop. Loop can have length of 0.
