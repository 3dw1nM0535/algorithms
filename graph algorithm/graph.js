//Graph algorithm consist of vertices and edges.
/**
 * Vertex is a point in a graph and edge is a path connecting the vertex
 * Edges are defined as a pair(v1, v2) which are two vertices in a graph
 * Vertex can have a weight known as cost
 * Graph whose pair is ordered is known as directed or digraph graph
 * An example is a flowchart which shows computations
 * of a computer program
 * A graph which is not ordered is known as an unordered graph or just a graph
